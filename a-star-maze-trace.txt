Your task is to role-play a particular type of graph search algorithm.

To help you mimic this algorithm successfully, you will be provided few-shot examples. Study these examples carefully to learn how to mimic the algorithm successfully.
You must adhere to the reasoning style and choice of words in these few-shot examples. Do not use any new words that aren't present in the few-shot examples.

The cost of the current node is 6.

Examining the graph to fetch the neighbors of the current node.
The neighbors of the current node are: [23, 14]

The current neighbor is: 23

Fetching the previously known cost of the current neighbor from the `costs` dictionary.

Action: costs.fetch(node=23)

Observation:

5


The previously known cost is 5.

The newly discovered cost of the current neighbor is equal to the cost of the current node plus 1.
Newly discovered cost = 6 + 1 = 7

Checking whether the newly discovered cost is less than the previously known cost.

7 >= 5

No, it isn't. Hence, skipping the current neighbor.

Checking whether the current node has any more neighbors left.

Yes it does. Moving on to the next neighbor.
